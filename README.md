## About

testBLAS
+ is based on the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) unit testing framework for C++.
+ uses the C++ BLAS interface from either [BLAS++](https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/blaspp) or [\<T\>LAPACK](https://github.com/tlapack/tlapack).

Some additional information:

1. The test files are in the [src](src) directory.Â To add a new test case, you just need to create a file `test_<something>.cpp` under the [src](src) directory and build testBLAS.

2. The test file [test_corner_cases.cpp](src/test_corner_cases.cpp) has corner cases tests based on the BLAS specifications from the implementation of the BLAS standard in [LAPACK](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/tree/master/BLAS/SRC). This is file is generated by the script in the folder [scripts](scripts).

## How to build testBLAS

testBLAS is built and installed with [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

### Getting CMake

You can either download binaries for the [latest stable](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) or [previous](https://cmake.org/download/#previous) release of CMake, or build the [current development distribution](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) from source. CMake is also available in the APT repository on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher.

### Dependencies

testBLAS depends on [BLAS++](https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/blaspp). Alternatively, you can use [\<T\>LAPACK](https://github.com/tlapack/tlapack) and, in this case, you will be using testBLAS to test the C++ template BLAS in \<T\>LAPACK. Both packages will allow you to access different BLAS implementations.

### Building testBLAS

If all dependencies are installed, testBLAS can be built using the standard CMake recipe

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -B build      # configuration step
cmake --build build # build step
```

You may need to inform the path for [BLAS++](https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/blaspp) or [\<T\>LAPACK](https://github.com/tlapack/tlapack). In the first case, the recipe would be

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -B build -D blaspp_DIR=<path-to-blaspp>   # configuration step
cmake --build build                             # build step
```

### CMake options

Standard environment variables affect CMake. Some examples are

    CXX                 C++ compiler
    CXXFLAGS            C++ compiler flags
    LDFLAGS             linker flags

* [This page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-env-variables.7.html) lists the environment variables that have special meaning to CMake.

It is also possible to pass variables to CMake during the configuration step using the `-D` flag. The following example builds testBLAS in debug mode inside the directory `build`.

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
cmake --build build
```

* [This page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html) documents variables that are provided by CMake or have meaning to CMake when set by project code.

### testBLAS options

Here are the testBLAS specific options and their default values

    # Option                         # Default

    TESTBLAS_BLAS                    blaspp
        
        C++ package used to access BLAS routines.
        Supported packages:
            blaspp, tlapack

## Testing

There are 5 workflows that run automatically:

1. Test the [BLAS templates in \<T\>LAPACK](https://github.com/tlapack/tlapack/tree/master/include/tlapack/blas).

2. Test [Netlib BLAS](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/tree/master/BLAS/SRC).

2. Test MKL BLAS.

2. Test BLIS.

2. Test OpenBLAS.
